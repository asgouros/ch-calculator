    <h1>Calculator</h1>
		<h2>Description</h1>
		<span>The goal of this challenge is to built a Javascript class in the form of an object that will serve as a calculator.
			The calculator should contain simple functions to perform the following actions:
			<ul>
				<li>Addition</li>
				<li>Subtraction</li>
				<li>Multiplication</li>
				<li>Division</li>
				<li>Power</li>
			</ul>
			You should display the result in the console.
			For each function your code should check the following:
			All arguments are required. If an argument is missing, throw an Error.
			Check if the action makes sense (i.e. division with 0 is wrong)
		</span>
		<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
		<span>
			The class functionality is presented by its tests contained in <strong>Calculator.spec.js</strong><br>
			To run them please use the <strong>Tests</strong>  tab and hit <strong>Run all tests<strong>.
